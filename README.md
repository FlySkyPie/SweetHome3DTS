## Background

SweetHome3D is a software implemented with Java, and it's have a sub-project called SweetHome3DJS, porting implementation to Web Browser by convertingg Java code into Javscript with Jsweet.

The goal of this project is get rid of Java toolchains and refactoring SweetHome3DJS into a form that more familiar by modern Frontend developers, such as NPM tool chain, ESM, Typescript...

## Original README

### SWEET HOME 3D JS v 7.5.2

This archive contains source code of Sweet Home 3D JS, a HTML5 3D viewer and editor
for Sweet Home 3D files saved with version 5.3 or a more recent version.

You may also download this source code with the following SVN command:

svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/sweethome3d/code/tags/V_7_5_2/SweetHome3DJS SweetHome3DJS


As this project depends on Sweet Home 3D, download and install also Sweet Home 3D source code from 
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/sweethome3d/SweetHome3D-7.5-src.zip 
or with the following SVN command: 

svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/sweethome3d/code/tags/V_7_5/SweetHome3D SweetHome3D


### HOW TO USE THIS SOURCE CODE

JavaScript code of this project is compatible with HTML5 / WebGL, and the directory where
you find this README.TXT file contains all the information required to run the code.

Part of the JavaScript code required to run examples is generated from Sweet Home 3D Java code 
with JSweet transpiler available at http://www.jsweet.org
To generate the missing JavaScript code and run tests, install JDK 11 or more recent, 
Node version 14 available at https://nodejs.org/ and Ant available at http://ant.apache.org/ 
then run ant command in the directory where you uncompressed this archive followed 
by the "viewerLibraries" or "applicationLibraries" target names.
The "viewerLibraries" target will create missing JavaScript code in lib/generated 
for Sweet Home 3D JS Viewer and required to run the HTML files found in the test directory 
of this archive with any compatible browser (except for test/testHome.html). 
The "applicationLibraries" target will create missing JavaScript code in lib/generated 
for Sweet Home 3D JS Editor and required to run test/testHome.html and test/testIndexedDB.html 
found in this archive with any compatible browser.  

The default target provided by build.xml Ant file concatenates .js files by license type, 
minifies them, and generates in install subdirectory a SweetHome3DJSViewer ZIP file 
that contains minified JavaScript code and HTML files you may use for your own web site. 

The main other targets named "applicationJspBuild" and "applicationPhpBuild" provided by build.xml 
generates in install subdirectory a web application .war file which you may deploy on a JSP 
server like Tomcat, and a .zip archive which you may deploy on a PHP server.
The JSP web application will let you create and modify in a browser the home plan passed in the 
parameter "home" of index.jsp page. Changes in a home edited with in this application will be 
automatically saved by the service in writeHomeEdits.jsp and read by the service readHome.jsp.
The PHP application will let you create, read and write homes with the "New", "Open", "Save" and 
"Save as" buttons available in Sweet Home 3D JS tools bar for this version. The edited home is
regularly saved in local IndexedDB for recovery purpose in case user's browser stops without 
saving first.

Read build.xml Ant file for more information about other available targets.
